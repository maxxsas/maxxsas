<p>
	As a Product Designer, I’ve spent years crafting interfaces, refining user flows, and guiding products from concept to launch. My tools have always been design-centric — <em>Figma, Adobe XD, design systems, user research </em> — the craft of shaping how products look and feel. But lately, there’s a new itch I can’t ignore: I don’t just want to design the blueprint, I want to build the house.
</p>



<p>
	That’s why React Native is next on my horizon. Once I master it, the creative bottleneck will disappear. No more handing off designs and waiting for implementation. I’ll be able to move from a sketch in the morning to a working prototype by night — polished, functional, and ready for users’ hands.
</p>


<p>
	I can already see the apps lined up in my mind:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Payment tools built with the local market in mind.</li>
	<li>Community exchange platforms that make reuse easy and rewarding.</li>
	<li>Micro-experiences so specific they feel hand-tailored to their audiences.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<img class="blog-banner" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Tinkoff_Bank_App.jpg" alt="ha d holding a mobile phone with an app's interface diplayed on the screen, showing a pie chart">
<p>
	The beauty of React Native is its flexibility. One codebase, multiple platforms — meaning my vision can live everywhere without compromise. My design skills have always been about empathy and clarity; pairing them with code means the barrier between idea and execution gets thinner than ever.
</p>

<p>
	Right now, I’m in the trenches of learning: breaking down HTML and CSS, playing with components, wrapping my head around JavaScript logic. It’s humbling, but it’s also invigorating. Every bug I fix is a reminder that soon, I’ll be fluent in this new language of creation.
</p>


<p>
	When that day comes, my work will no longer be limited to what I can hand off. I’ll design, build, and ship — owning the entire product journey from spark to shipped app. And that’s when the real magic will start.

<p>
	When I set my sights on learning React Native by August 2026, I knew this wasn’t going to be a sprint. It was going to be a marathon — a year of showing up every day, following a routine, and refusing to let the initial excitement fade.
</p>

<p>

	I didn’t just make a vague promise to myself; I made a plan. I broke the next twelve months into weekly milestones — each one small enough to be achievable, but together building the skills I’ll need to write real, working apps. And every day, I commit three hours to it. No negotiations. No “I’ll do it tomorrow.”
</p>

<br>





<h2>The Routine That Fuels Progress</h2>
<p>
	My day has a rhythm now. I sit down, review where I left off, and pick up exactly where I need to be for that week’s target. If the goal for the week is “learn CSS Grid” or “fetch data from an API,” then I don’t wander off into unrelated tutorials or let myself get distracted by shiny new tools. I focus on this week’s step.
</p>

<p>
	The beauty of a routine is that it removes the daily decision-making. I don’t wake up asking, “Do I feel like learning today?” I just show up. And showing up consistently has started to build momentum.
</p>

<br>





<h2>Keeping the Fire Burning</h2>
<p>
	Motivation is fragile — it fades when the work gets hard. So I’ve built habits that keep my energy alive:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		I celebrate small wins — even a simple form that works perfectly gets a mini fist-pump.
	</li>

	<li>
		I track progress visually, ticking off each week’s skill like a badge earned.
	</li>

	<li>
		I remind myself that each checkbox is a brick in the foundation of my future skills.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	On tough days, I don’t pressure myself to “do amazing work.” I just keep the streak alive. Some days are breakthroughs; others are just steady steps forward — but every step counts.
</p>

<br>





<h2>The Power of Sticking to the Plan</h2>
<p>
	This journey is about more than learning to code. It’s about proving to myself that I can take a long-term vision, map it out, and execute it — day after day, week after week.
</p>


<p>
	By August 2026, I’ll have more than just technical skills. I’ll have a body of work that proves I can commit, persevere, and deliver. And I’ll have the confidence that comes from knowing that when I set a goal, I follow through.
</p>

<p>
	The fire isn’t just in the dream — it’s in the discipline. And I’m keeping it burning.

	When I started this journey toward mastering React Native by August 2026, I promised myself I’d document the process — not just the wins, but the small, sometimes messy steps along the way. This is Progress Update 1, and right now, I’m still laying the foundation.
</p>

<br>





<h2>Where I Am Right Now</h2>
<p>
	At this stage, my days are spent inside HTML and CSS. I’m working with classes and IDs, doing minimal text formatting, and creating lists. It’s basic, but it’s also the backbone of everything that will come later.

</p>

<p>
	The exciting part? I’m using these early skills to build the very blog you’re reading right now. This space isn’t just where I’ll share my updates — it’s also my current project. Every heading, list, and style tweak here is part of my learning process in action.
</p>

<br>





<h2>Why This Stage Matters</h2>
<p>
	It’s tempting to look ahead to flashy, complex apps — but without this groundwork, nothing else will stand. Classes and IDs might seem small compared to JavaScript logic or React components, but they’re the building blocks that make a site organized and scalable.
</p>

<p>
	Right now, I’m not just learning how to write HTML and CSS — I’m learning to think about structure, readability, and reusability. These habits will follow me into every stage of my coding journey.
</p>

<br>





<h2>What’s Next</h2>
<p>
	In the coming weeks, I’ll move deeper into styling — exploring <strong> Flexbox, CSS Grid, and responsive design </strong> so this blog (and everything else I make) looks good on any screen. From there, it’s on to JavaScript, where things will start to move and react.
</p>


<p>
	For now, though, I’m focused on doing this stage well. It’s not glamorous, but it’s progress — and progress, no matter how small, is how I’ll get to the finish line in August 2026.
